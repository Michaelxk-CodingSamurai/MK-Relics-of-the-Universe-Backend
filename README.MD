# MKRelicsOfTheUniverseBackend

## About
* Relics of a universe is a blog created in a Hackathon for Astronomy Enthusiasts to share pictures they took of the night sky.

## Installation

1. Run `-NPM Install`
2. Use `http://localhost:5000/blogs/seed` to populate database.
3. Run server.

The front-end application is in my `MKRelicsOfTheUniverseFrontend` repository.

## My Developer Role
* Created the database with CRUD functions using MongDB and Node.js by contributing the following:
* 1. Set up the Express.js and connected to port: LocalHost 5000
* 2. Created the models and filled the data with information that will be pushed into the app
* 3. Set up the routes for the controllers in order to implement the HTTP requests.
* 4. Set up the HTTP requests inside the Controller and created GetAll, GetById, Post, Put, and Delete methods using Postman
