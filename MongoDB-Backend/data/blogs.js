        blogText: 'As humans spread out across the Earth, the locations of new colonies were driven by the accessibility of resources: not only food and water, but also arable land, forests and minerals. Access to such resources remains important as the economy moves into space. Here, water has emerged as the pre-eminent resource to exploit first. The question then becomes, from where will we extract the water? Along with the moon and near Earth asteroids as potential sources, Mars is an important candidate.',

        blogText: 'The mass of the Milky Way has been estimated to be as low as 500 billion solar masses (where one solar mass equals the mass of our Sun) to as high as 2 to 3 trillion solar masses. This dramatic uncertainty has a lot to do with the different approaches used by astronomers to “weigh” our galaxy, not to mention the uncertainty caused by a rather enigmatic variable: dark matter. This invisible, and still hypothetical, form of matter accounts for as much as 90 percent of our galaxy’s total bulk, but as it cannot be seen or measured directly, dark matter presents serious problems for astronomers.',

        blogText: 'Like the Eta Aquariids in May, the Delta Aquariid meteor shower in July favors the Southern Hemisphere and tropical latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere. But these meteors can be seen from around the world. These faint meteors appear to radiate from near the star Skat or Delta in the constellation Aquarius the Water Bearer. The maximum hourly rate can reach 15 to 20 meteors in a dark sky. The nominal peak is around July 27-30, but, unlike many meteor showers, the Delta Aquariids lack a very definite peak. Instead, these medium-speed meteors ramble along fairly steadily throughout late July and early August. An hour or two before dawn usually presents the most favorable view of the Delta Aquariids. At the shower’s peak in late July 2019, the rather faint Delta Aquariid meteors will not have to contend with moonlight, so this is indeed a favorable year for watching this shower. You’ll still be seeing Eta Aquarids when the Perseids peak in August.',
